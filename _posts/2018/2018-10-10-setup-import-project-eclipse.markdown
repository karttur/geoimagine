# Introduction

A PyDev project in <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> can be imported either as a complete project, or by building a backbone and copying and pasting selected parts. To setup Karttur's GeoImagine Framework you can use either method. This post describes how to import the Framework as a complete project and the [next](../setup-copy-project-eclipse/) post covers how to to build a PyDev backbone and then copying and pasting selected parts. Setting up the Python environment is covered in the [previous](../setup-conda-environ/) post. After completing either this, or the [next](../setup-copy-project-eclipse/) post, the [following](../setup-xml/) post describes the Framework key concepts and how to define processes and data.

# Prerequisites

To follow this post you must have the complete Spatial Data Integrated Development Environment (SPIDE) installed, including <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> set up for PyDev, <span class='app'>Anaconda</span> and <span class='app'>PostgreSQL</span>. How to do that is described in a separate blog: [Install and setup spatial data IDE](https://karttur.github.io/setup-ide/). You need to install and setup all the parts in that blog, preferably using [Python3 and Anaconda3](https://karttur.github.io/setup-ide/blog/python3-upgrade/). How to create a customised virtual Python environment for Karttur's GeoImagine Framework within conda is described in the [previous](../setup-conda-environ/) post.

The rest of this post assumes that you have accomplished the installation of the SPIDE.

# Cloning Karttur's GeoImagine Framework

The core of Karttur's GeoImagine Framework is freely available at Github.com. To see which parts are available at any time, check the [GeoImagine Python Packages](https://karttur.github.io/geoimagine/packages/) page.

Clone (or download) the entire library of packages (you can also leave out any package that you are not interested in), and store them on your local drive. You can store them directly in your <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> workspace, or in any other location. What is important is that the hierarchical organization and naming of all packages, modules and files remain intact.

When saving or cloning, the package name is the same as the GitHub repository where it is stored, _WITH THE "geoimagine-" PART OMITTED_. Thus the package stored under the respository "geoimagine-setup_db" must be renamed as "setup_db" on your local system.

# Eclipse project

As stressed above, you must have your Eclipse SPIDE setup and running. If not, you have to go back and complete the installation as described in the blog [Install and setup spatial data IDE](https://karttur.github.io/setup-ide/).

## Project configuration

An Eclipse PyDev project is defined by two files:

- <span class='file'>.project</span>
- <span class='file'>.pydevproject</span>

These are hidden files that must exist directly under the root folder of the PyDev project. To actually see and access the files, use the <span class='app'>Terminal</span> and change directory (<span class='terminal'>cd</span>) to the cloned project:

<span class='terminal'>$ cd /path/to/cloned/project/rootfolder</span>

Then list all <span class='terminal'>ls -a</span> files in the that root folder:

<span class='terminal'>$ ls -a</span>

The <span class='terminal'>ls -a</span> command also lists hidden files, and you should see both <span class='terminal'>.project</span> and <span class='terminal'>.pydevproject</span> in the returned list.

You can open the hidden files and read them with <span class ='terminalapp'>pico</span>:

<span class='terminal'>$ pico .project</span>

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
        <name>KartturGeoImagine</name>
        <comment></comment>
        <projects>
        </projects>
        <buildSpec>
                <buildCommand>
                        <name>org.python.pydev.PyDevBuilder</name>
                        <arguments>
                        </arguments>
                </buildCommand>
        </buildSpec>
        <natures>
                <nature>org.python.pydev.pythonNature</nature>
        </natures>
</projectDescription>
```

<span class='terminal'>$ pico .pydevproject</span>

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<?eclipse-pydev version="1.0"?><pydev_project>
<pydev_pathproperty name="org.python.pydev.PROJECT_SOURCE_PATH">
<path>/${PROJECT_DIR_NAME}</path>
</pydev_pathproperty>
<pydev_property name="org.python.pydev.PYTHON_PROJECT_VERSION">python interpret$
<pydev_property name="org.python.pydev.PYTHON_PROJECT_INTERPRETER">Default</pyd$
</pydev_project>
```

Once you have confirmed that the two project files exists, and that the \<name\> tag in <span class='file'>.project</span> corresponds to the name of the root folder of the project, you can import Karttur's GeoImagine Framework to Eclipse.

## Import project

Start <span class='app'>Eclipse</span>. To import an existing project you need to bring up the import dialog. As usual with <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> there are several ways to bring up this dialog:

- <span class='menu'>File : Import</span>, or
- right click in the <span class='tab'>Pydev Package Explorer Window</span>

The <span class='tab'>Import</span> dialog window opens. Select _General_ --> _Existing Projects into Workspace_ and then click <span class='button'>Next</span>.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.commonurl }}/images/{{ site.data.images[page.figure1].file }}">
<figcaption> {{ site.data.images[page.figure1].caption }} </figcaption>
</figure>

A new dialog window <span class='tab'>Import Projects From File System or Archive</span> opens. Navigate to the root directory for the project that you want to import (the one with the two hidden project files).

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.commonurl }}/images/{{ site.data.images[page.figure2].file }}">
<figcaption> {{ site.data.images[page.figure2].caption }} </figcaption>
</figure>

If this is a project root folder, a check box will appear with the project folder ticked. If not you have either located the wrong folder, or the root folder lacks the two hidden project files. Unless you already cloned the project into your Eclipse workspace (or want to keep it at some other locations) click the checkbox <span class='textbox'>Copy project into workspace</span>.

Click <span class='button'>Finish</span> to import a complete version of KartturÂ´s GeoImagine Framework.
